# UBC Serverless Price Optimization Tool (SPOT)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Save money on your serverless functions.

SPOT uses your functions' performance data to configure their allocated memory and CPU for the lowest possible cost.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3
- AWS CLI (configured with `aws configure`)
- MongoDB (by default, accessible on `localhost:27017`)

### Steps
1. Create and activate a virtualenv.
```bash
python3 -m venv src-env
source src-env/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install SPOT as an editable package.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Run it!
```bash
parrotfish
```

## Running new benchmark fucntions
### Add a new function
Follow the instructions [here](src/serverless_functions/README.md)
### Prepare and train
1. Profile to get initial data 
```bash
parrotfish <function_name> -p
```
2. fetch new logs from CloudWatch
```bash
parrotfish <function_name> -f
```
3. train with selected model
```bash
parrotfish <function_name> -tm polynomial
```
4. You can get recommendation without updating config file at or after the previous step with `-r`
5. update the config file and calculate error rate
```bash
parrotfish -um polynomial
```
Graphs for error and prediction vs epoch can be found corresponding folders in `serverless_functions/<function>/`

### Profiling alternative
To invoke only with the configurations defined in `config.json`, use `-i` flag
```bash
parrotfish <function_name> -i
```
