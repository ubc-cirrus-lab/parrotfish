Parrotfish is a tool for optimizing configuration of serverless functions using parametric regression.
You can learn more about the architecture and performance of Parrotfish in our recent 2023 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC '23) paper: https://cirrus.ece.ubc.ca/papers/socc23_parrotfish.pdf

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python >= 3.8

#### Requirement to run Parrotfish for AWS Lambda Function:
- AWS CLI (Configured with `aws configure`)

#### Requirement to run Parrotfish for Google Cloud Function:
- gcloud CLI (Authenticate with your credentials: `gcloud auth application-default login`)
- Should enable the Cloud Billing API in your account.


### Steps
1. Create and activate a virtualenv.
```bash
python3 -m venv src-env
source src-env/bin/activate
```

2. Download and install the latest Parrotfish release. 
```bash
pip install ${path to parrotfish-version.whl}
```
> **Note:** If you want to make changes to the code, you can install Parrotfish as an editable package:
```bash
export PACKAGE_VERSION="0.0.0"
pip install -e .
```

3. Create and optimize your Parrotfish configuration file. Check [here](src/configuration/README.md) to learn more about options and see some examples.

4. Run Parrotfish!
```bash
parrotfish --path ${path to the configuration file}
```
```text
Arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH, -p PATH  Path to the configuration file
  --verbose, -v         Set the logging level to INFO
  --apply               Apply optimized configuration
```

## Using custom models and objectives
To explore the effects of other objectives and models, you need to modify the `src/objective/objective.py` and 
`src/objective/parametric_function.py` files.
If you need to change the sampling process, e.g. the initial samples, you need to modify the `src/sampling/sampler.py` 
file.
